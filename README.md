# CreditCardFraudDetection
The Fraud Detection Project is an application that uses machine learning algorithms to detect and prevent fraudulent activities. It analyzes large datasets and identifies patterns and anomalies to flag potential instances of fraud. 

1. Data Preprocessing: 
Data from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud. The project includes prepares the dataset for analysis, and inconsistent data to ensure accurate fraud detection.

2. Machine Learning Models: The project utilizes various machine learning models, such as logistic regression, Random Forests, and Gradient boosting algorithms, to train and predict fraudulent activities. These models are trained using labeled datasets and can be easily retrained with new data.

3. Reporting and Visualization: The application generates comprehensive reports and visualizations to help users understand the detected fraud patterns. It provides insights into the data, highlights potential vulnerabilities, and assists in making informed decisions.
